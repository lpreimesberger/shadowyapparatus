## 1. Introduction

The advent of quantum computing poses an existential threat to current cryptographic systems. Classical digital signatures based on RSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA will become vulnerable to Shor's algorithm when sufficiently large quantum computers emerge. Blockchain systems, which rely fundamentally on digital signatures for transaction authorization and block validation, face particular risk.

Shadowy Apparatus addresses this challenge by implementing a complete post-quantum blockchain protocol. The system features:

- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: ML-DSA-87 digital signatures providing 224-bit security
- **UTXO Transaction Model**: Bitcoin-inspired unspent transaction outputs with quantum-safe modifications
- **Hybrid Consensus**: Proof-of-work mining with post-quantum signature verification
- **Modern Architecture**: High-performance P2P networking, WebAssembly integration, and comprehensive APIs

Unlike existing post-quantum cryptographic research projects, Shadowy Apparatus is designed as a complete, production-ready blockchain system with practical applications in mind.

## 2. Background and Motivation

### 2.1 The Quantum Threat

Quantum computers capable of breaking current cryptographic systems are projected to emerge within 10-20 years. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has responded by standardizing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, including:

- **ML-KEM** (Module-Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation)  
- **ML-DSA** (Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm)
- **SLH-DSA** (Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm)

### 2.2 Blockchain Vulnerability

Existing blockchain systems face several quantum vulnerabilities:

1. **Transaction Signatures**: ECDSA signatures can be broken by quantum computers
2. **Address Generation**: Public key derivation from addresses becomes vulnerable
3. **Mining Algorithms**: Some hash functions may be weakened by quantum attacks
4. **Consensus Security**: Byzantine fault tolerance assumptions may not hold

### 2.3 Design Goals

Shadowy Apparatus was designed with the following objectives:

- **Quantum Resistance**: All cryptographic primitives must resist quantum attacks
- **Performance**: Transaction throughput comparable to modern blockchains
- **Decentralization**: No single points of failure or control
- **Practicality**: Real-world applications and developer accessibility
- **Future-Proofing**: Adaptable to evolving post-quantum standards

## 3. System Architecture

```

### 3.2 Node Architecture

Each Shadowy node runs multiple concurrent services:

- **Blockchain Service**: Block validation, storage, and chain management
- **Consensus Service**: P2P communication and block propagation  
- **Mining Service**: Proof-of-work mining and block production
- **Mempool Service**: Transaction validation and ordering
- **Farming Service**: Plot-based storage farming (optional)
- **RPC Services**: HTTP and gRPC APIs for external access

### 3.3 Network Topology

The network operates as a decentralized peer-to-peer overlay:

- **Full Nodes**: Store complete blockchain and validate all transactions
- **Mining Nodes**: Additionally perform proof-of-work mining
- **Light Clients**: SPV-style verification with trusted full nodes
- **Archive Nodes**: Long-term storage of historical data

## 4. Cryptographic Foundations

### 4.1 ML-DSA-87 Digital Signatures

Shadowy Apparatus uses ML-DSA-87 (Dilithium Mode3) for all digital signatures:

**Parameters:**
- Security Level: NIST Level 3 (224-bit quantum security)
- Public Key Size: 1,952 bytes
- Signature Size: 4,627 bytes  
- Private Key Size: 4,016 bytes

**Advantages:**
- Standardized by NIST (FIPS 204)
- Mature implementation and security analysis
- Deterministic signatures (no randomness required)
- Fast verification suitable for blockchain applications

### 4.2 Hash Functions

The protocol employs multiple hash functions for different purposes:

- **SHA-256**: Block headers, transaction IDs, Merkle trees (quantum-resistant)
- **BLAKE3**: High-performance hashing for mining and general purposes
- **SHA-3**: Future compatibility and specific protocol components

### 4.3 Address Generation

Shadowy addresses are derived from ML-DSA-87 public keys:

```
Address = Base58(NetworkByte + BLAKE3(ML-DSA-PublicKey)[0:20] + Checksum)
```

**Address Types:**
- **S-addresses**: Standard addresses (51 characters)
- **L-addresses**: Legacy compatibility addresses (41 characters)

### 4.4 Key Derivation

The system implements a post-quantum equivalent of BIP-32 hierarchical deterministic keys:

```
ChildKey = ML-DSA-KeyGen(HMAC-SHA512(ParentKey, Index + Seed))
```

## 5. Consensus Mechanism

### 5.1 Hybrid Proof-of-Work

Shadowy Apparatus uses a hybrid consensus mechanism combining:

- **Proof-of-Work Mining**: BLAKE3-based mining algorithm
- **Post-Quantum Signatures**: ML-DSA-87 block signing
- **Finality Gadget**: Optional BFT finality for critical applications

### 5.2 Mining Algorithm

The mining algorithm is designed to be GPU-friendly while remaining ASIC-resistant:

```
Hash = BLAKE3(BlockHeader + Nonce + VDF(Timestamp))
Target = 2^(256-Difficulty)
Valid iff Hash < Target
```

**Features:**
- Variable Difficulty: Adjusts every 2016 blocks (≈2 weeks)
- VDF Integration: Verifiable Delay Functions prevent timestamp manipulation
- Memory-Hard Variant: Optional memory-hard mining for enhanced decentralization

### 5.3 Block Structure

```go
type Block struct {
    Header     BlockHeader
    Body       BlockBody
    Signature  ML_DSA_Signature
}

type BlockHeader struct {
    Version       uint32
    PrevHash      [32]byte
    MerkleRoot    [32]byte
    Timestamp     uint64
    Difficulty    uint32
    Nonce         uint64
    VDF_Proof     VDFProof
}
```

### 5.4 Finality and Reorganizations

- **Probabilistic Finality**: 6 confirmations (≈60 minutes)
- **Economic Finality**: Deep reorganizations become economically prohibitive
- **Checkpoint System**: Periodic checkpoints prevent long-range attacks

## 6. Transaction Model

### 6.1 UTXO Architecture

Shadowy follows a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model similar to Bitcoin but adapted for post-quantum cryptography:

```go
type Transaction struct {
    Version    uint32
    Inputs     []TransactionInput
    Outputs    []TransactionOutput
    Locktime   uint32
    Timestamp  string
}

type TransactionInput struct {
    PreviousTxHash  [32]byte
    OutputIndex     uint32
    ScriptSig       []byte
    Sequence        uint32
}

type TransactionOutput struct {
    Value           uint64  // Satoshis
    ScriptPubkey    []byte
    Address         string
}
```

### 6.2 Script System

A simplified script system enables basic programmability:

- **P2PKH**: Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (standard transactions)
- **P2SH**: Pay-to-Script-Hash (multi-signature, timelock)

### 6.4 Transaction Validation

Each transaction undergoes comprehensive validation:

1. **Syntactic Validation**: Proper format and structure
2. **Semantic Validation**: Valid input references and amounts
3. **Signature Verification**: ML-DSA-87 signature validation
4. **Script Execution**: Script interpretation and validation
5. **Double-Spend Prevention**: UTXO consumption tracking

## 7. Network Protocol

### 7.1 P2P Communication

Shadowy nodes communicate using a custom P2P protocol built on TCP/IP:

```

│   Application   │    │   Application   │
├─────────────────┤    ├─────────────────┤
│  Shadowy P2P    │◄──►│  Shadowy P2P    │
