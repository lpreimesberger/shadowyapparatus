# Shadowy Blockchain Syndicate Pooling System

## Overview

The Shadowy blockchain implements an innovative anti-centralization mining pool system called **Four Guardian Syndicates**. This system automatically distributes miners across four named syndicates to prevent any single entity from dominating the network while ensuring small miners receive fair rewards through pooled mining.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Anti-Centralization**: Prevents any syndicate from controlling more than ~35% of blocks
2. **Automatic Balancing**: Routes new miners to lowest-capacity syndicates
3. **Temporary Membership**: NFT-based memberships with 8-day maximum lifespan
4. **Gaming Resistance**: Proof density analysis over 144-block "gross" periods
5. **Fair Distribution**: Capacity-based assignment ensures equitable resource allocation

## The Four Guardian Syndicates

Based on East Asian mythology, the four syndicates are:

### 🐉 Seiryu (青龍) - Azure Dragon of the East
- **Element**: Wood
- **Season**: Spring
- **Color**: Blue/Green

### 🐅 Byakko (白虎) - White Tiger of the West  
- **Element**: Metal
- **Season**: Autumn
- **Color**: White

### 🐦 Suzaku (朱雀) - Vermillion Bird of the South
- **Element**: Fire
- **Season**: Summer
- **Color**: Red

### 🐢 Genbu (玄武) - Black Tortoise of the North
- **Element**: Water
- **Season**: Winter
- **Color**: Black

## Technical Implementation

### Syndicate Types
```go
type SyndicateType int

const (
    SyndicateSeiryu SyndicateType = iota // Azure Dragon (East)
    SyndicateByakko                      // White Tiger (West)
    SyndicateSuzaku                      // Vermillion Bird (South)
    SyndicateGenbu                       // Black Tortoise (North)
    SyndicateAuto                        // Automatic assignment
)
```

### NFT-Based Membership

Syndicate membership is implemented through NFTs with the following structure:

```go
type SyndicateData struct {
    Syndicate        SyndicateType `json:"syndicate"`
    MinerAddress     string        `json:"miner_address"`
    ReportedCapacity uint64        `json:"reported_capacity"` // bytes
    JoinTime         int64         `json:"join_time"`         // unix timestamp
    ExpirationTime   int64         `json:"expiration_time"`   // max 8 days
    RenewalCount     uint32        `json:"renewal_count"`
}
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Automatic Assignment (`SyndicateAuto`)
- Miners can request automatic assignment instead of choosing a specific syndicate
- System assigns to the syndicate with lowest total capacity
- Includes dominance prevention - won't assign if it would exceed 35% threshold
- Finds alternative syndicates if primary choice would cause dominance

#### 2. Capacity-Based Balancing
- Each syndicate tracks total adjusted capacity of all members
- New miners automatically routed to lowest-capacity syndicate
- Capacity adjusted based on proof density analysis (anti-gaming)

#### 3. Dominance Prevention (35% Threshold)
- Tracks block wins over rolling 2016-block fortnight windows
- Prevents any syndicate from winning >35% of recent blocks
- Real-time monitoring and automatic rebalancing

#### 4. Block Win Tracking
```go
type BlockWinner struct {
    BlockHeight uint64        `json:"block_height"`
    Winner      SyndicateType `json:"winner"`
    MinerAddr   string        `json:"miner_addr"`
    Timestamp   time.Time     `json:"timestamp"`
}
```

### Time Epochs and Cycles

#### Chain Week (1008 blocks)
- Standard unit for auto-renewal cycles
- NFT memberships auto-renew every chain week
- ~7 days at 10-minute block times

#### Gross Period (144 blocks)  
- Minimum adjustment period for proof analysis
- Used for capacity adjustment based on unique proofs
- Prevents rapid gaming of the system
- ~24 hours at 10-minute block times

#### Fortnight Window (2016 blocks)
- Rolling window for dominance calculations
- Tracks syndicate performance over ~14 days
- Used for 35% threshold enforcement

### Membership Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Miner creates syndicate membership NFT
   - Cost: 0.1 SHADOW (10,000,000 satoshi)
   - Maximum duration: 8 days
   - Automatic or manual syndicate selection

2. **Active Period**: NFT provides syndicate membership
   - Block rewards distributed through syndicate
   - Capacity tracking and proof analysis
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Expiration/Renewal**: NFT expires after 8 days max
   - Auto-renewal possible every 1008 blocks (chain week)
   - Manual melting returns proportional SHADOW
   - Expired NFTs automatically removed from syndicate

### Anti-Gaming Mechanisms

#### Proof Density Analysis
- Monitors unique proofs submitted per gross (144 blocks)
- Adjusts reported capacity based on actual proof submission
- Prevents miners from inflating capacity claims
- Formula: `AdjustedCapacity = ReportedCapacity * (UniqueProofs / ExpectedProofs)`

#### Capacity Correlation
- Compares storage size vs unique proof correlation
- Detects miners gaming the capacity reporting system
- Triggers rebalancing when anomalies detected

## Usage Examples

### Joining a Syndicate (Automatic Assignment)
```go
// Create transaction with automatic syndicate assignment
tx := NewTransaction()
tx.AddSyndicateJoin(
    SyndicateAuto,           // Let system choose best syndicate
    minerAddress,            // Miner's address
    storageCapacityBytes,    // Reported storage capacity
    7,                       // Membership duration (7 days)
)
```

### Joining a Specific Syndicate
```go
// Join the Azure Dragon syndicate specifically
tx.AddSyndicateJoin(
    SyndicateSeiryu,         // Specific syndicate choice
    minerAddress,
    storageCapacityBytes,
    8,                       // Maximum 8-day duration
)
```

### Checking Syndicate Statistics
```go
// Get all syndicate performance data
syndicateManager := blockchain.GetSyndicateManager()
allStats := syndicateManager.GetAllSyndicateStats()

for syndicate, stats := range allStats {
    fmt.Printf("%s: %d members, %.2f%% blocks won\n", 
        syndicate.Description(), 
        len(stats.Members),
        stats.WinPercentage)
}
```
