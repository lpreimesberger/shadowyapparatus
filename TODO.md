### Priority Guidelines
- **High Priority**: Core functionality, security, user experience
- **Medium Priority**: Performance, developer experience, ecosystem
- **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have features, polish, advanced features

### Architecture Principles
- **Post-quantum first**: All cryptography must be quantum-resistant
- **Performance focused**: Optimize for throughput and latency
- **Developer friendly**: APIs should be intuitive and well-documented
- **Security by design**: Security considerations in every component
- **Decentralization**: Avoid single points of failure or control
